## About Salty.IO
Salty.IO is a Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum which uses Automatic Atomic Arbitrage (AAA) to generate yield and provide Zero Fees on all swaps. It's an Ethereum-based DEX with zero swap fees, yield-generating Automatic Arbitrage, and a native WBTC/WETH backed stablecoin. With AAA, market inefficiencies are arbitraged at swap time to create profits - which are then distributed to liquidity providers and stakers and used to form Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) for the DAO.

The exchange is 100% decentralized at launch - with all parameters, regional exclusions, whitelisting, and contracts controlled by the DAO itself.
