## About me

Since I joined Code4rena in February 2023, I have established a solid track record as a security researcher, currently ranking #19 in the 90-day leaderboard, #26 in 2025. Throughout my journey, I've participated in 19 different audits across various protocols including Maia DAO Ecosystem, Dopex, LoopFi, DYAD, and Lambo.win. My work spans multiple blockchains, with findings specifically related to Solana (as evidenced in the Pump Science audit regarding SOL balance validation) and Scroll (in the Unruggable Invitational audit). 

My contributions include discovering 24 high-severity vulnerabilities (with 1 solo find) and 29 medium-severity issues (with 4 solo finds). Several of my findings were selected for official reports, including "User underpay for the remote call execution gas on root chain" (high-severity) in Maia DAO Ecosystem, "Bringing a position from unsafe to safe by liquidation paritally" (medium-severity) in LoopFi, and "zkTrie maximum depth limit is not enforced in Scroll" (medium-severity) in the Unruggable Invitational contest. My expertise has helped secure numerous DeFi protocols, from lending platforms and DEXes to complex derivatives products, contributing to the overall security of the blockchain ecosystem.
