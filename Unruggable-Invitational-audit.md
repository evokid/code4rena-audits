## About Unruggable Invitational
The Unruggable Invitational audit involved a scoped subset of verifier smart contracts from the Unruggable Gateways codebase. This protocol is designed to prevent rug pulls and enhance Ethereum naming security. The audit focused on the project's security mechanisms that help protect users from common cryptocurrency scams where developers abandon projects after taking investors' funds.
